<h1>Hey Guys what's up!!</h1>

<h4>So, it's just a lazy afternoon and I was wondering there are many fellas like me who likes to experiment with linux. Lots of things can go sideways. And every time the
setup process is painful. I myself find it very annoying. Every time i have to google and sometimes the solutions don't work. I'm not saying mine's gonna work.</h4>

Purpose
--------
<h4>Basically I wanted to learn bash scripting for a long time. Now that I faced a github credential managing issue a few minutes ago, I wondered why not create simple bash 
scripts instead of copy pasting each command from google everytime. Maybe I'll learn some bash also benefit someone. That's the soul purpose of this repository.</h4>

<h4>I'll try to commit every single little problem I faced or any optimization in terms of time while installing/removing some packages or whatever.</h4>
