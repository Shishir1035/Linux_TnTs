<h1>Hey Guys what's up!!</h1>

<h4>So, it's just a lazy afternoon and I was wondering there are many fellas like me who likes to experiment with linux. Lots of things can go sideways. And every time the
setup process is painful. I myself find it very annoying. Every time i have to google and sometimes the solutions don't work. I'm not saying mine's gonna work.</h4>

<h4>Basically I wanted to learn bash scripting for a long time. Now that I faced a github credential managing issue a few minutes ago, I thought why not create simple bash 
scripts instead of copy pasting each command fro google. Maybe I'll learn some bash also benefit someone. That's the soul purpose of this repository.</h4>

<h4>I'll try to commit every single little problem I faced or any optimization in terms of time while installing/removing some packages or whatever.</h4>

<h1>It's just a FUN project!!</h1>
<h3>If it helps you somehow that would be my pleasure.</h3>
